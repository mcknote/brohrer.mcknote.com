Most explanations of deep learning are tough to understand if you aren't fluent in math and computers, or they make it sound like magic. This is a description of deep neural networks with no fancy math and no computer jargon. This talk was recorded during the Boston Open Data Science Conference.

很多關於**深度學習**（Deep Learning）的解釋都很艱深，如果讀者不具備一定的數學或電腦科學知識，可能很難理解，或是乾脆把它當作魔法看待。
